# Getting Started 

Download and install node.js

cd into cloned folder - 'npm i' to install packages

Open another terminal and cd into src. Run 'node server.js' to start running the node js backend server. You should get "listening on port 8080" if it's working.

On the other terminal, run 'npm start' to run front end.

## Using the GUI.

Create new nodes and connect them together via the backend to the frontside.

Add a "prompt" if you want to create an mp3 file for that node.

Adding a "trigger" will not create a sound file, but will be stored as part of the object connection structure.

If you have a desired flow, like above, you can save and 

## Saving.

If you have the desired flow, click save. This will create an mp3 file per prompt and will also produce an JSON object structure of the flow.

## Variables.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
